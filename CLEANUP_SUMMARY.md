| `lib/widgets/unified_add_card_widget.dart` | 549  | Implement logo selection                      | Medium   |

## üéØ **Recommendations**

### **Immediate Actions Completed**

1. ‚úÖ Removed empty `lib/repositories/mock_card_repository.dart`
2. ‚úÖ Removed placeholder `test/helpers/mock_screen_brightness.dart`

### **Future Cleanup Opportunities**

#### **TODO Comments**

- Most TODO comments are for future feature enhancements rather than incomplete functionality
- The logo selection TODO in `unified_add_card_widget.dart` could be removed since logo selection is already implemented in the main app
- Consider creating GitHub issues for remaining TODOs and removing them from code

#### **Mock Architecture**

- Consider consolidating to either manual mocks or generated mocks consistently
- Current mixed approach works but could be streamlined for maintainability

#### **Generated Files**

- `.dart_tool/` directory contains many generated files that are properly ignored
- No cleanup needed for generated files

### **Code Quality Notes**

- No unused imports detected in main source files
- Platform mocking is well-centralized in `PlatformMocks`
- Test structure is well-organized with clear separation

## üèÜ **Cleanup Results**

- **Files Removed**: 2
- **Lines of Code Cleaned**: ~10 (empty/placeholder content)
- **Build Artifacts**: No changes needed
- **Dependencies**: No changes needed
- **Tests**: All existing tests should continue to pass

## ‚ú® **Final State**

The codebase is now cleaner with:

- No empty or unused mock files
- Clear separation between test utilities and main code
- Well-organized mock architecture for different testing needs
- Consolidated platform channel mocking

All remaining files serve active purposes in the development and testing workflow.
