## Guidelines

1. **Be user-focused**: Write from the user's perspective
2. **Be specific**: Mention concrete improvements
3. **Be positive**: Focus on benefits and improvements
4. **Keep it concise**: Users don't read long release notes
5. **Use emojis sparingly**: They can help but don't overuse them

## Character Limits

- Google Play Store: 500 characters per language
- App Store: No strict limit but keep it reasonable (under 4000 characters)

## Languages

Remember to translate release notes for all supported languages in your app.
