# scripts/

This folder contains helper scripts used by the project for releases, testing and documentation.

## Purpose

- Keep scripts discoverable and documented.
- Provide a helper to normalize shebangs and make scripts executable safely.

## Common scripts

- `build-info.sh` - Print build metadata.
- `bump-version.sh` - Bump project version and tags.
- `docs-maintenance.sh` - Run documentation cleanup and checks (timestamps, generated files).
- `generate-localizations.sh` - Run Flutter localization generation.
- `generate-release-notes.sh` - Create release notes drafts.
- `install-git-hooks.sh` - Install repository git hooks (pre-commit, pre-push, ...).
- `pre-commit-hook.sh`, `pre-push.sh` - Hook scripts referenced by `install-git-hooks.sh`.
- `run-tests.sh` - Run the project's test suite locally.
- `release.sh`, `master-release.sh`, `quick-release.sh` - Various release helpers.

## How to use

Run a script directly from the repository root. Example:

```bash
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

If you see scripts with inconsistent shebangs or missing execute bits, run the helper below:

```bash
./scripts/normalize-shebangs.sh
```

### About `normalize-shebangs.sh`

- The helper will rewrite the first line of `*.sh` files to `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and add execute permissions.
- It only operates on regular files in `scripts/` (not subdirectories) and keeps a `.bak` when updating (deleted afterwards).

### Safety notes

- The script updates files in-place. Use Git to review changes and revert if needed.

## Typical workflow

1. Check status: `./build-info.sh`
2. Run checklist: `./release-checklist.sh`

## Tips

## ðŸ“¦ Dependency Management

Keep your Flutter dependencies up to date with automated tools.

### Manual Updates

```bash
# Interactive dependency update with safety checks
./update-dependencies.sh
```

### Automated Updates (GitHub)

- **Dependabot**: Automatically creates PRs for dependency updates (configured in `.github/dependabot.yml`)
- **Weekly Checks**: GitHub Actions workflow runs weekly to check for outdated dependencies
- **Status in build-info**: `./build-info.sh` shows current dependency status

### Localization Files

```bash
# Regenerate localization files from ARB sources
./generate-localizations.sh
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Typical Workflow

1. **Check status**: `./build-info.sh`
2. **Run checklist**: `./release-checklist.sh`
3. **Create release**: `./master-release.sh` or `./quick-release.sh`
4. **Upload to Play Store** using the generated AAB file

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- All scripts are designed to be safe - they check for issues before making changes
- Scripts will show you exactly what they're doing
- You can always cancel by pressing Ctrl+C
- The `master-release.sh` script is perfect for first-time users
